# Angular2-Typescript-Webpack
A starter structure for using Webpack with Angular 2 &amp; Typescript
Most of the Angular 2 + Webpack starters I have come across seem relatively noisy
this template should allow users to get up and running quickly. This project requires npm to be installed on your machine: https://www.npmjs.com/

PRs and feedback welcome!

To get up and running simply pull down the project and run:

`npm install`

Then to start hacking on a webpack dev server run:

`npm start`
